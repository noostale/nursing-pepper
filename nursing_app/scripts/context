Notes for LLM Context
1. Room Numbering Convention
   - Hundreds digit = floor number (e.g., 2xx → Floor 2).
   - Last two digits = specific room/grid location.

2. Specialist Roles
   - Every clinical room lists a primary provider (MD, NP, or equivalent) as well as a nurse or technician.
   - If a department has multiple clinicians, they are split into “Clinic A,” “Clinic B,” etc.

3. Opening Hours
   - Most outpatient clinics run Monday–Friday, with many offering limited Saturday hours. Sunday is generally closed for specialized services (except walk-ins and certain labs).
   - Administrative offices and HR/IT follow typical business-hours patterns.

4. Workflow Example
   - A patient arrives at Reception (Room 100) between 7:30 AM and 8:00 PM to check in.
   - If they need a GP, they are directed to Room 101 or 102. If they need imaging, they proceed to Rooms 110–113.
   - If referred to a specialist (e.g., Cardiology), they go to Floor 2 (Rooms 201–205).
   - Any lab work for endocrinology is done in Room 312 on Floor 3.
